:left_right_arrow: Currently Genymotion - scrcpy and my project only supports the distributions : Windows, Linux and Mac. 

It focuses on:

:arrow_right: lightness-native, displays only the device screen

:arrow_right: performance-30~60fps

:arrow_right: quality-1920Ã—1080 or above

:arrow_right: low latency-35~70ms

:arrow_right: low startup time-~5 second to display the first image

:arrow_right: non-intrusiveness-nothing is left installed on the device

:arrow_forward:

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Make sure you enabled ADB Debugging on your device(s) you can check out my README_xxxxxxxxx.md (where xxxxxxxx is the name of your distribution. e.g. Linux) details for enabling ADB Debugging are provided there.

On some devices, you also need to enable an additional option to control it using keyboard and mouse.

Install scrcpy on Windows, Linux, Mac with the respective README_xxxxxxxxx.md (where xxxxxxxx is the name of your distribution. e.g. Linux)
